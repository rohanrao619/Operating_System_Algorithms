# Operating System Algorithms
This Repository contains implementation of some **Process Scheduling** and **Disk Scheduling** algorithms (in C Language) that are commonly used in Operating Systems. It also contains solutions to some **Process Synchronization Problems**.

Process Scheduling Algorithms : 
* First Come First Serve (FCFS)
* Shortest Job First (SJF)
* Longest Job First (LJF)
* Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)
* Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
* Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF)
* Preemptive Priority
* Non-Preemptive Priority
* Round Robin (RR)

Disk Scheduling Algorithms :
* First Come First Serve (FCFS)
* Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)
* SCAN
* C-SCAN
* LOOK
* C-LOOK

Process Synchronization Problems :
* Readers-Writers Problem
* Producer-Consumer Problem
* Dining Philosophers Problem
